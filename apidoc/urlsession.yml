name: Modules.URLSession
summary: Wrapper to support iOS's NSURLSession class for background downloads.
description: |
  These APIs are supported on iOS 7 and later.

  The URL session module (`com.appcelerator.urlSession`) provides the application
  the ability to download large content via HTTP while the application is in the
  background. With this module, you can

    1. Create a URL session and a background download task.
    2. Monitor events to check the progress of the download and session.
    3. Cancel downloads and invalidate sessions.

  URL session events are monitored through the following iOS application-level events:

    * <Titanium.App.iOS.backgroundtransfer>
    * <Titanium.App.iOS.downloadprogress>
    * <Titanium.App.iOS.downloadcompleted>
    * <Titanium.App.iOS.sessioncompleted>
    * <Titanium.App.iOS.sessioneventscompleted>

  These events are monitored as application-level events by using the
  `addEventListener` method with the Titanium.App.iOS namespace.

  For more information on getting started, refer to the
  [iOS Background Services guide](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/iOS_Background_Services).

extends: Titanium.Module

  methods: [addEventListener, fireEvent, removeEventListener]
  properties: [bubbleParent]

methods:
  - name: finishTasksAndInvalidate
    summary: Invalidates the given session object, allowing any outstanding tasks to finish.
    description: |
      This method returns immediately without waiting for tasks to finish. Once a session is invalidated,
      new tasks cannot be created in the session, but existing tasks continue until completion. Once
      invalidated, references to the events and callback objects are broken. Session objects cannot be
      reused. To cancel all outstanding tasks, call `invalidateAndCancel` instead.
    parameters:
      - name: session
        summary: URL session object.
        type: Object
    deprecated:
      since: 6.1.0
      notes: Use <Modules.URLSession.Session.finishTasksAndInvalidate> (on the session object) instead.

  - name: invalidateAndCancel
    summary: Cancels all outstanding tasks and then invalidates the session object.
    description: |
      Once invalidated, references to the events and callback objects are broken. Session objects cannot
      be reused. To allow outstanding tasks to run until completion, call
      `finishTasksAndInvalidate` instead.
    parameters:
      - name: session
        summary: URL session object.
        type: Object
    deprecated:
      since: 6.1.0
      notes: Use <Modules.URLSession.Session.invalidateAndCancel> (on the session object) instead.

  - name: backgroundDownloadTaskWithURL
    deprecated:
      since: 6.1.0
      notes: Use <Modules.URLSession.Session.downloadTask> on the session directly.
    summary: |
      Creates a download task for the specified URL, within the provided session object and saves the
      results to a file.
    description: |
      Once this function is called, the download starts automatically. The progress of
      the download can be monitored by listening to the `downloadprogress`, `downloadcompleted`,
      `sessioneventscompleted` and `sessioncompleted` events.
    parameters:
      - name: session
        summary: URL session object.
        type: Object
      - name: url
        summary: URL to download content from.
        type: String
    returns:
      summary: Task's identifier number.
      type: String

properties:
  - name: configuration
    summary: The configuration used for this url session.
    description: |
      Configuration options for an <Modules.URLSession.Session> object.
      When a session is created, a copy of the configuration object is made.
      you cannot modify the configuration of a session after it has been created.

      The shared session uses the global singleton credential, cache
      and cookie storage objects.

      An ephemeral session has no persistent disk storage for cookies,
      cache or credentials.

      A background session can be used to perform networking operations
      on behalf of a suspended application, within certain constraints.
